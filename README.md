# Covid19-Temperature-Detection-Data-Collection-Microbit



The idea , to develop a system that could detect the symptoms of COVID-19 truly fascinated me . I wanted to create system that could detect the most crucial symptom of COVID (https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/main-symptoms/  ). I looked for a suitable dataset and read different articles regarding the symptoms and their frequency  , comparing and contrasting each in terms of percentages and statistics . Eventually  I elected to go ahead with fever because the statistics transparently proved that this symptom was the most common amongst the patients and was a staring edge . Not only that , I thought this would be very suitable for the microbit , as the microbit already has an inbuilt temperature sensor meaning that no extra wires or devices would be needed making it extremely portable , compact and convenient for the end-user to operate
