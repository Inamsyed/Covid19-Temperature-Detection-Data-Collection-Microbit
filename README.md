# Intro
The year 2020  was an extremely momentous year . It has brought substantial changes and will have a long lasting effect , positive and negative ,on the future . One of the major conveyers of this great change was the outbreak of the coronavirus .  

# Basic Idea
One of the aspects I was extremely curious about were the symptoms of the COVID. I had a strong urge to explore ways that schools or universities can systematically monitor an individuals health through out the day and detect for any signs that may manifest that the individual has contracted COVID. 

# Research
Taking this idea into account , I started looking through the official HSE website. In this website , they discussed various aspects about the virus such as statistics on the number of cases , deaths etc.  They also discussed existing solutions and measures to prevent the spread of the deadly virus such as wearing facial mask , social distancing (2m) etc . But with some of these measures I strongly felt that they couldn't be immensely accurate as they were highly dependent on ones choice . This was an issue that I felt wasn't addressed profoundly .  

# Goal
I wanted to create system that could detect the most crucial symptom of COVID (https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/main-symptoms/  ). I looked for a suitable dataset and decided to go ahead with fever .I elected this because the statistics transparently proved that this symptom was the most common amongst the patients.

Not only that , I thought this would be very suitable for the microbit , as the microbit already has an inbuilt temperature sensor meaning that no extra wires or devices would be needed making it extremely portable , compact and convenient for the end-user to operate
